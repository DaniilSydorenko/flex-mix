Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nWelcome to Flex-Mix. \r\nIt is a boilerplate for frontend development based on flex-grid(http://flexboxgrid.com/) and sass boilerplate(https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:DaniilSydorenko/flex-mix.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bower \r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### or\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo bower install --allow-root\r\n```\r\n\r\n## NPM\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Application structure\r\nIt is application structure from scratch.
